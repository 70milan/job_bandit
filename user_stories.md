# Project Roadmap & User Stories (Consolidated)

Based on your feedback, I've grouped the requirements into 4 core high-level features for better clarity.

## Feature 1: AI Model Excellence & Performance
Ensuring the "brain" of the app is fast, accurate, and transparent.

- **User Story 1.1:** As a user, I want my default model choice (GPT-4o) to be reliably remembered by the application.
- **User Story 1.2:** As a user, I want the response times for GPT-5 and higher reasoning models to be optimized for interview flow.
- **User Story 1.3:** As a user, I want to verify that when using screenshot capabilities, the system accurately logs the model and response time.

## Feature 2: Session & Profile Management
Making the application's core workflow reliable and flexible.

- **User Story 2.1:** As a user, I want to create new sessions without errors and open past sessions to continue exactly where I left off.
- **User Story 2.2:** As a user, I want the ability to customize my "Target Role" so the AI doesn't assume I am always a "Data Engineer".

## Feature 3: Premium UI/UX Design
Creating a professional, highly interactive, and responsive interface.

- **User Story 3.1:** As a user, I want a modern UI with premium aesthetics, smooth transitions, and tactile "clickable" feedback on all controls.


## Feature 4: Project Integrity & Business Logic
Handling security, safety, and professional distribution.

- **User Story 4.1:** As a developer, I want all personal info (resumes/profiles) completely scrubbed and ignored from the Git history for security. (Implemented: Scrubbed personal info and build artifacts from all branches. Updated README with developer setup instructions.)
- **User Story 4.2:** As a business owner, I want an offline, hardware-locked licensing system where users send me a Request Code and I generate a License Key, eliminating the need for a central server.
- **User Story 4.3:** As a developer, I want to completely expunge all legacy hardcoded license keys from `backend/main.py` locally AND from all git history/branches to prevent forensic retrieval.
